`texhs` is a Haskell library for parsing TeX and LaTeX documents with
basic support for category code management and the main macro systems
of TeX, LaTeX2e and LaTeX3 (`xparse`).
Special support for selected LaTeX packages is planned
(e.g. `gb4e`, `tikz`, `forest`).

`texhs` is being developed at the open access publisher [Language
Science Press](http://langsci-press.org/) as part of its document
conversion pipeline.
